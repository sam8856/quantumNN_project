## Choosing a dataset for a ML or NN algorithm
### Coffee-dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmoyote/coffee-reviews-dataset
Nearly 2000 Coffee in diff. roastings with rating, price, origin, roaster-country
Guess that could be fun and it wouldn't be to have to extract some nice features
Could find out the bigest coffee-growers and roasters in the world, depending on the climazones
### Emission dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022
Contains most of the emission data of a lot of countries from 2002 up to 2022
We could make predictions for future emissions, don't know the work-intensity of getting this dataset in a proper ML-algorithm
### Physical strength correlation with fear
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/physical-strength-correlation-with-fear-related
Sounds exciting although it's a bit more work. But I guess the features and therefore the prediction results are more exciting and useful than maybe in the other datasets...
